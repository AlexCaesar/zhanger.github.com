###Who am I?
I am Alex Garibay. I’m a simple guy with a passion for learning about new technologies and electronics. I was born and raised in Kansas and haven’t lived anywhere else. I went to Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas to get my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

###My Occupation
I currently work at Perceptive Software in Shawnee, KS as a Software Developer. It’s a pretty awesome gig. I get to work on our Integration Server product creating RESTful API using Java.

###My Hobbies
Aside from learning about technology, I have a few hobbies:

* Listening to electronic music
* Creating electronic music
* Learning Ruby
* Running (using barefoot shoes)
* Having fun with friends
* Karate (green belt)

I got into electronic music around middle school and immersed myself in it in college. I liked it so much that I learned how to create my own songs (I have a small musical background from playing percussion in band when I was younger). My songs can be found on my <a href="music.html">Music</a> page.
